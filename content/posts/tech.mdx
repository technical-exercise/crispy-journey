# Tech notes

  - Were there any assessments regarding the effectiveness of these
    facial recognition deployments before procurement? If not, will
    there be any assessments regarding the effectiveness of these facial
    recognition deployments after procurement?

  - How do these agencies plan to measure the success or failure of a
    facial recognition deployment?

  - The `AWS Rekognition` documentation talks about use by law
    enforcement:
    
    > When you use facial recognition in law enforcement scenarios, you
    > should use confidence thresholds of 99% or higher and not make
    > decisions based solely on the predictions returned from facial
    > recognition software. A human should confirm facial recognition
    > software predictions and also ensure that a person’s civil rights
    > aren’t violated.
    
    As far as I can tell, there's no connection between these
    recommendations and AWS terms of use. These recommendations could
    potentially be used for non-liability by AWS.
    
    Do the providers that have been contracted issue similar
    recommendations?

  - Have the systems been optimized in any way for Mexican data? For
    instance, how good are they at working with indigenous / native
    faces?

  - Are there any plans to re-train the models with for instance
    indigenous / native faces? If so, where will these training sets
    come from? Will the training sets, or the re-trained models be
    shared back with the providers that have been contracted?

  - On the internet there's general guidelines and specifications for
    video that's going to be used in facial recognition. For instance:
    <https://www.quora.com/What-quality-of-image-should-be-used-in-face-recognition-so-that-processing-does-not-get-slow>
    
    In what ways do the cameras that are going to be used comply with
    these type of recommendations?

  - I still have to think about the differences between the AWS *Celebrity
    Recognition* and *Face Search* products. Still, in my tests I have
    found that *Celebrity Recognition* fails to detect the Mexican
    celebrities in the following photos:
