# Tech notes

  - Before procurement, was there any testing as regards the effectiveness 
    of a possible facial recognition deployment? Will there be any such testing
    after contracts have been awarded?

  - Do these government agencies have any metrics for measuring the success
    or failure of facial recognition technology? Here I'm not thinking about benchmarks
    like the NIST's [vendor test](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt-ongoing),
    but rather about the evaluation of specific facial recognition deployments.

  - The *AWS Rekognition* documentation includes recommendations for law enforcement:
    
    > When you use facial recognition in law enforcement scenarios, you
    > should use confidence thresholds of 99% or higher and not make
    > decisions based solely on the predictions returned from facial
    > recognition software. A human should confirm facial recognition
    > software predictions and also ensure that a person’s civil rights
    > aren’t violated.
    
    As far as I can tell, there's no connection between these paragraphs from the
    AWS documentation and the AWS terms of use. These recommendations could
    potentially be used for non-liability by AWS.
    
    Do the providers of facial recognition technology that have been contracted issue similar
    recommendations?

  - Have the systems been optimized in any way for their use in Mexico? For
    instance, how good are they at working with Mexican indigenous / native
    faces?

  - Are there any plans to re-train the models with faces of Mexican citizens?
    If so, where will these training sets
    come from? Will the training sets, or the re-trained models be
    shared back with the facial recognition providers that have been contracted?

  - On the internet there's general specifications for
    video and facial recognition. For instance:
    <https://www.quora.com/What-quality-of-image-should-be-used-in-face-recognition-so-that-processing-does-not-get-slow>
    
    Does the CCTV camera refurbishment take these types of recommendations
    into account?

  - I still have to think about the differences between the AWS *Celebrity
    Recognition* and *Face Search* products. Still, in my tests I have
    found that *Celebrity Recognition* fails to detect the Mexican
    celebrities in the following photos:
